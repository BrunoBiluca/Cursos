# KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)

The KISS principle is about striving for simplicity. 

Modern programming languages, frameworks and APIs have powerful means to create sophisticated solutions for various kinds of problems. 

Sometimes developers might feel tempted to write “clever” solutions that use all these complex features. 

The KISS principle states that a solution is better when is uses less inheritance, less polymorphism, fewer classes, etc.
